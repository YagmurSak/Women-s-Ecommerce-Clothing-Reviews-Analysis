# Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews Analysis

This project covers data analysis, processing and missing value management operations on women's clothing e-commerce customer reviews and product data obtained from the Kaggle platform. The dataset includes textual feedback, ratings and product-related meta information.

My goal is to conduct analyses to understand customer behaviour and satisfaction in the e-commerce sector. Sentiment analysis is suitable for applications such as recommendation systems and data discovery. Projects such as customer satisfaction prediction can be developed with natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning methods.

# About Dataset

This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions. Because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the review text and body have been replaced with “retailer”.

**Clothing ID:** Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece being reviewed.
